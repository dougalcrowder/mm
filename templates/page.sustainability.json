Right from the go we only use water based inks, where possible we use natural pigment.  We source organic cottons and use other plant based fibres including linens and viscose.  <\/p><p>Block printing is an old age technique that we champion and employee the most skillful master printers keeping this craftsmenship in the forefront of our industry.  The prints speak for themselves and string our heart cords with the feeling they envoke and the skill that is needed to produce such peices of art.   We are also immensly proud of supporting our local UK craftsman and are big supporters of UK manufacturing.  Thus we pay above the average price as we feel we are paying a fair and reflective price.<\/p><p>Molly Mahon is a very small cog in the industry we are in and we have made significant changes both her in the UK and abroad.  It is our goal as we grow and become more established to be able to give more to this sustainable change that is now more at the forefoont of all producers minds and actions.<\/p>",
