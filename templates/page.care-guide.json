We use Azo-free, non toxic water based paints, which we feel is a healthier choice for the printer and environment.<br/><br/>Dry cleaning is recommended for our fabrics. Up to 5% shrinkage can be expected.<br/><br/>We cannot accept returns on the basis of the marks of the block not being exact, this is the beauty of this style of printing.<br/><br/><strong>Woven Stripe & plain dyed linens & cottons:<br/><br/></strong>These fabrics are handwoven and hand dyed, slight imperfections are to be expected and colour variations can occur between batches.<br/><br/><strong>Digital Fabrics and Wallpaper:<br/>Deerhyrst, Wallpapers<br/><br/></strong>Due to the nature of the natural base cloths and small batch printing method it is not always possible to obtain an exact colour match. Whilst we make every effort to ensure that colours correspond to our samples, slight variations may occur.<br/><br/>Our wallpapers can be wiped clean with a damp cloth.<br/><br/>For full information on our <strong>Fabric and Wallpaper Information Guides</strong> follow the links below.<br/><br/><a href=\"https://mollymahon.com/pages/fabric-care\" title=\"FABRIC CARE AND USAGE\">FABRIC CARE AND USAGE</a></p><p><a href=\"https://mollymahon.com/pages/wallpaper-care\" title=\"WALLPAPER CARE AND USAGE\">WALLPAPER CARE AND USAGE</a></p>",
