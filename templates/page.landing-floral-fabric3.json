The fabulous thing about patterns is that you don’t have to limit yourself to one. Mixing prints can give a home a contemporary, energising quality - and that way you won’t have to struggle to decide!</p><p>There are no rules when it comes to getting creative in the home. Clash abstract patterns with big blooming florals, or twin stripy designs with standout natural shapes such as <a href=\"https://mollymahon.com/products/wallpaper-coral-blue\">Coral</a> or Hawaiian themed <a href=\"https://mollymahon.com/products/wallpaper-lani-denim\">Lani</a>. The key is to pick complimenting colours… light blue and pale green, yellow and indigo, or bright pink and sage.</p><p>If matching is more your style, pick a patterned wallpaper for each room and pull out key colours to inject into your furnishings. From towels to bedspreads, highlighting one or two shades throughout your accessories will really make your pattern pop.</p>\n        </div></div>\n    </div><div class=\"text inset\">\n      <div class=\"flex vertical-start align-left color-dark_text\"><div class=\"rte\">\n        <p>Why not take your matching designs one step further and go for the fully printed look?

back over 4,500 years - and we still love it today. One of the many things that drew Molly to hand block printing was the personal connection with each and every piece. The odd movement between each print of paint gives the finished product a sense of authentic energy that can’t be achieved with a machine. Like the imperfections of real life, it’s what makes it beautiful.</p><p>The block printing process starts in Molly’s countryside studio where she turns doodles from nature, travels and her daily life into repeat designs. Each is then carved into a unique lino or wooden block, and brought to life on quality fabrics and paper by our team of master printers in India.&nbsp;</p><p></p>\n        </div></div>\n    </div></div>\n\n</div><div id=\"shopify-section-template--14380328255546__166258375996ca2554\" class=\"shopify-section spaced-section divider\"><div class=\"divider mt-l mb-l\"><div class=\"inner\">\n  <hr>\n  </div></div>\n\n</div><section id=\"shopify-section-template--14380328255546__1662478609382f904c\" class=\"shopify-section multicolumn-section\"><div class=\"multicolumn inner pt-s pb-s\">\n  \n<ul class=\"multicolumn grid\"><li class=\"column half narrow no-image\"><div class=\"text_wrap flex vertical-start align-left color-dark_text\"><h3 class=\"h2 large\">Keeping Traditions Alive</h3><div class=\"rte\"><p>Human connection is key to us, from the joy our designs evoke to the people responsible for their creation. We know every single artisan we work with in India and the UK - and their skills are second to none!&nbsp;</p><p>By partnering with crafts people in Jaipur, we’re able to support rich traditions that connect communities and keep the inimitable quality of handmade art alive. Each piece of block-printed cloth and paper is passed through multiple skilled hands, making it a treasured story to pass down through generations.</p><p>Recently we’ve experimented with another form of block printing to create our <a href=\"https://mollymahon.com/products/wallpaper-strawberry-grass\">Strawberry</a> and <a href=\"https://mollymahon.com/products/wallpaper-bindi-blue\">Bindi</a> designs.
