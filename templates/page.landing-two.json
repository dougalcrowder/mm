Mixing prints can give a home a contemporary, energising quality - and that way you won’t have to struggle to decide!There are no rules when it comes to getting creative in the home. Clash abstract patterns with big blooming florals, or twin stripy designs with standout natural shapes such as Coral or Hawaiian themed Lani. The key is to pick complimenting colours... light blue and pale green, yellow and indigo, or bright pink and sage. If matching is more your style, pick a patterned wallpaper for each room and pull out key colours to inject into your furnishings. From towels to bedspreads, highlighting one or two shades throughout your accessories will really make your pattern pop.<\/p>",
